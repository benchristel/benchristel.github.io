title: My Favorite Opinions About Modern Software Development

## Boundaries - Gary Bernhardt

In which Gary Bernhardt presents a compelling vision for a "Faux-O" paradigm of software design, complementing the existing paradigms (functional, object-oriented, and imperative). He motivates his ideas with observations about unit testing in the existing paradigms, particularly about what it means for a test to be "isolated". This talk made me completely rethink my use of mocks and stubs in unit testing, and paved the first step of my journey toward TDD enlightenment.

## Making Badass Developers - Kathy Sierra

In which Kathy Sierra gives some practical advice on how we can make the most of our limited mental resources. An excellent follow-up to "Your Brain At Work".
