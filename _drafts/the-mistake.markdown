Candidates for "The Mistake"

Logical and emotional patterns of thought do not interfere with one another

- Words used in code/math shouldn't affect how we understand it
- The presentation of a problem shouldn't affect our solutions
- 

- people can, should, and do make logical decisions
  - thoughts are cheap, code is expensive
