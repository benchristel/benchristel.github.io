title: Testing Pure Functions
---

Pure functions always have a range of outputs that is smaller than (or the same size as) their domain of inputs. (Mathematical notions of countable infinities don't apply hereâ€”nothing in computing is really infinite). Many inputs may produce the same output, and you cannot (in general) derive a unique input given the output of a function.

Take, for example, the following `square` function:

```javascript
let square = x => x * x
```

There are a few reasons why one pure function might call another. Let's say there's a function `a` that calls `b`.

- `a` might do some computation that is not solely a function of its own arguments to determine the arguments to pass to `b`.
- `a` might pass `b`'s return value to another function.

Any nontrivial function `a` must do one of the above. If it does neither, that means that one of the following is true:

- `a` is a middle man: it is just passing its parameters to `b` and returning `b`'s return value
- `a` composes its parameters in some way to compute the arguments to `b`. This violates the single-responsibility principle
