<h2>Immortality</h2>

<p>A man went to see the sage. He said, "Life is so short and our
effect on the world is so limited. How can I be happy knowing that
someday I'll disappear without leaving a trace?"</p>

<p>"You're mortal because you're a human,"
said the sage. "Learn to be something eternal instead."</p>

<p>The man bowed before the sage and later became her disciple.
One day as he was meditating by a stream he became the sound of
a waterfall.</p>
