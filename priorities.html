<h2>Priorities</h2>

<p>A student went to see the master. "Programming is so hard,"
he complained. "It seems like nothing is ever finished,
and I always lose track of what needs to be done."</p>

<p>"Why don't we have dinner together and talk about it then?"
replied the master. So the student invited the master over for dinner.</p>

<p>The master offered to help cook. They started making rice.</p>

<p>But when the student went to fill the rice pot with water, he noticed
that it was dirty. He went to clean it and realized the soap had run out.
He ducked under the sink to get a new bottle of soap, and saw that one
of the pipes was leaking.</p>

<p>He quickly put the pot, which he was still holding, under the pipe to
catch the dripping water. "But now we can't make rice!" he wailed.</p>

<p>"That's true," the master replied. "But you found something to do
that was more important than making rice."</p>

<p>Then the two of them went to a restaurant.</p>
