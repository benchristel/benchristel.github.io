<h2>Indispensable</h2>

<p>A student approached the master and asked, "How can I become enlightened?"</p>

<p>The master replied, "Give up all meat. Become a vegetarian."</p>

<p>The student balked at this, but gave it a try.
Eventually he learned to make vegetarian dishes that were as tasty as meat
dishes. But he was still not enlightened.</p>

<p>He returned to the master and asked again,
"How can I become enlightened?"</p>

<p>The master replied, "Give up driving. Walk everywhere you go."</p>

<p>The student could not imagine how he'd cope with this new restriction,
but gave it a try. Gradually he learned to manage. He became fitter and
healthier. He even began to enjoy walking everywhere. But he was still
not enlightened.</p>

<p>He returned to the master, who told him,
"Give up your books and computer. Work, sleep, and meditation should
be your only pursuits."</p>

<p>The student almost snapped at this incredible demand, but did as he
was instructed. He soon discovered he was spending more time baking
bread and working in the garden. Despite everything, he was still happy.
But he was not enlightened.</p>

<p>He returned to the master and said, "I've given up everything I
thought I needed. Now I'm practically living the life of an ascetic.
You can't possibly ask me to sacrifice anything else!"</p>

<p>The master replied: "There's just one more thing.
Give up cleaning your kitchen."</p>

<p>The student recoiled in horror, and was enlightened.</p>
