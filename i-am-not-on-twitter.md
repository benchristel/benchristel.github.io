# I am not on Twitter

I've felt recently that I don't have as much free time as I
did in high school, though I'm pretty sure I actually have
quite a bit more. I think the problem may be that I spend my
time outside of work in uncreative ways.

It's weird, but I think creativity thrives on frustration.
In high school, I had maybe an hour free every weekday, but
I made those hours count. I wrote, composed, drew, invented.
Now, with no hard constraints on my time,
it's surprisingly hard to find the same sort of focus and
motivation.

It's also possible that while my weekdays are more free,
my weekends are actually less free. I spend a lot more time
doing personal and household maintenance stuff on weekends
nowâ€”shopping, cooking, cleaning... that sort of thing.

I also recall that I spent large swaths of time during my
childhood being bored. I rarely have time to be bored now,
and [maybe that's part of the problem](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/06/19/adam-phillips-boredom/).
