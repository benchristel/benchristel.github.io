# Bliki

I haven't been doing much with this blog lately, but I've
been quite prolific on my [bliki](https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki).
[Check it out!](https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki)

## What's a Bliki?

Ward Cunningham coined the term "bliki". It's a portmanteau of
"blog" and "wiki". Martin Fowler describes it [here, in "WhatIsaBliki"](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/WhatIsaBliki.html):

> I decided I wanted something that was a cross between a wiki and a blog - which Ward Cunningham immediately dubbed a bliki. Like a blog, it allows me to post short thoughts when I have them. Like a wiki it will build up a body of cross-linked pieces that I hope will still be interesting in a year's time.

Like a blog, a bliki is personal and informal. Like a wiki,
it is a network of hyperlinked pages, with each page
organized around a single topic or concept.

## Why is a bliki?

I've written about this [before](/blog/2017/12/09/turns-out-i-don-t-like-blogging/), but the chronological,
semi-permanent nature of a blog triggers my perfectionist
urge. A blog feels very public somehow, like a sequence of
proclamations to the world. Part of the problem, I think,
is that whatever I post on the blog goes on the front page
and immediately becomes the most prominent, public part of
the siteâ€”so it had better be at least as good as whatever
came before!

The push toward perfectionism is unfortunate.
While my thoughts on a given topic might be too
rough and vaguely-formed for me to want to shout them from
the rooftops, they might also be worth recording in a format
amenable to sharing, critique, and revision.

Another problem with blogs is that they are _sequential_.
Each post should preferably stand on its own, but if it can't
do that it should at least rest on what came before. This
puts me in a tricky position when writing. Should I assume
my readers are familiar with the fundamentals of, say, test doubles?
Should I assume they're familiar with my previous writing on the subject?
If I don't assume familiarity, won't I end up rehashing the same
points over and over again in every post?

By contrast, a bliki is dyed-in-the-wool hypertext; it is
unabashedly nonlinear. This means that I can write assuming
knowledge of other topics, and just link to the pages on
those topics.

## Other cool things about blikis

I use GitHub's wiki feature for my bliki. A wiki on GitHub
is just a flat directory of markdown files. It's also a
Git repo, so I can clone it and edit it with whatever tools
I like.

One of the best tools I've found for this is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Like a GitHub
wiki, an Obsidian "vault" is just a collection of markdown
files. This consilience makes for a great editing experience.
Obsidian has a markdown/WYSIWYG combo editor that's truly
beautiful, and a rich ecosystem of plugins and themes.

## Keeping in touch

You can subscribe to updates to my bliki via the [RSS feed](https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki.atom):
`https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki.atom`.
Thanks to [Leith Abdulla](https://eleith.com/) for pointing out that this feature exists.

If you have feedback on the bliki, or a question, I'd love
to hear it. You can contact me by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/issues/new).

I'd be especially interested in hearing from you if you
have a bliki of your own that I could link to. I think the
[Federated Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_Wiki)
concept is cool and in line with the ["36Views"](https://github.com/benchristel/benchristel.github.io/wiki/36Views) pattern, which is my preferred way of presenting
information.
