# Bowling Kata Redux

After making some improvements to [Verse](https://benchristel.github.io/verse/),
I was able to complete a solution to the [Bowling Kata](/blog/2018/08/23/the-bowling-kata-in-verse/).
[You can play with the solution here](/assets/bowling-kata/finished.html).

The current solution doesn't keep track of how many pins
are still standing, so you can bowl e.g. two 9s in one
frame. Just for fun, you might try fixing that issue by
doing some validation on the input and showing an
appropriate error message.
