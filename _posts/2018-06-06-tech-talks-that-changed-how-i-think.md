title: Tech Talks That Changed How I Think
---

I facilitate tech video lunches every Monday at Pivotal's
Palo Alto office (basically a bunch of people congregate in
a conference room, the company buys us food, and we watch
someone talk about software development for 30-45 minutes.
It's good fun!) Over the last four years this has caused me
to watch hundreds of talks from many different conferences.

In no particular order, here are the technical videos that
have had the most influence on me.

## "Boundaries" — Gary Bernhardt

When I first saw this talk, in 2014, it blew my mind. Gary
dissects one of the core problems facing software
developers: how to unit-test effectively while still
enabling code to change over time. He backs up the
theory with concrete examples and even a live demo.

"Boundaries" greatly influenced the design of

## "Ease at Work" — Kent Beck

[Google discovered](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)
that psychological safety was *the* key factor
differentiating high-performing teams. Kent talks about how
psychological safety is (or isn't) achieved on the software
teams he's worked with.
