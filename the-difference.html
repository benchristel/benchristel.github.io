<h2>The Difference</h2>

<p>"I want to be a great programmer," said the student to the master,
"but I don't understand what makes code great. What's the difference
between your code and mine?"</p>

<p>The master thought for a few seconds. "Mine runs slower," he replied.</p>

<p>"What?" exclaimed the student. "That can't possibly be the
only difference! If that's the case, what makes you a master, and
me only a student?"</p>

<p>The master pondered for a long time. Finally he said "My
code will still be running after I'm dead."</p>
